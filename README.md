These insights will be used to help Loiuse to understand precisely if she will be able to fulfill her dream to start "Fever"


## Analysis and Challenges: 

#### Explain how you performed your analysis using images and links to code, as well as any challenges you encountered and how you overcame them. If you had no challenges, describe any possible challenges or difficulties that could be encountered.
1. It took sometime to understand the data especially what each head of the column actually meant. This was important as incorrect understanding would affect the analysis
2. Getting used to pivot table and getting desired results was also not easy at the start as slight misunderstanding in the requirements would affect the final results 


####  What are two conclusions you can draw about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date?
Pre-summers and summers i.e. May, June and July  are decent time for the theatre due to many reasons 
Aslo, the caimpgaign success number (298) was higher in the above mentioned months than in any other month through out the year

#### What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Setting unreasonably high expectations and budget is not helpful in making a project successful. 
Those with the lower and realistic budget have been more successful 

#### What are some limitations of this dataset?
Any project can be better analyzed if the cost and revenue both numbers are available. In this dataset, we do not have the cost incurred or cost expected. Had the cost data been available, we could have done more in depth and accurate analysis

#### What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We could have created Average money donation graph and Pledge amount
