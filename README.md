# kickstarter-analysis
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends


## Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

In this project we will help Louise, who is a play writer start, a playwright, fund her play Fever.
She wants to start a crowdfunding campaign and we will be helping Louise in her campaign from start to finish using organize, sort, and analyze the crowdfunding and determine whether there are specific factors which make projects successful
These insights will be used to help Loiuse to understand precisely if she will be able to fulfill her dream to start "Fever"


## Analysis and Challenges: 

1. It took sometime to understand the data especially what each head of the column actually meant. This was important as incorrect understanding would affect the analysis
2. Getting used to pivot table and getting desired results was also not easy at the start as slight misunderstanding in the requirements would affect the final results 


####  Conclusions about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date?
Pre-summers and summers i.e. May, June and July  are decent time for the theatre due to many reasons 
Aslo, the caimpgaign success number (298) was higher in the above mentioned months than in any other month through out the year

#### Conclusions about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Setting unreasonably high expectations and budget is not helpful in making a project successful. 
Those with the lower and realistic budget have been more successful 

#### Limitations of this dataset?
Any project can be better analyzed if the cost and revenue both numbers are available. In this dataset, we do not have the cost incurred or cost expected. Had the cost data been available, we could have done more in depth and accurate analysis

#### Other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We could have created Average money donation graph and Pledge amount
